GSA INTERNATIONALIZATION HOWTO
==============================

Usage of gsa:i18n
=================

To allow a string in GSA to be translated, you must use the XPath function
gsa:i18n with the following parameters:

"id"      : The identifier that is used to look up the translated string.
             Usually this is the untranslated version, but it can be different
             if the parameter "default" is used.
"context" : The context name which specifies which context groups should
             be considered when looking up the string. See the section
             "Contexts" for details on how this works
"default" : The string to use when no translation is found. If omitted,
             the id is used.
            A common usage for not using the id as the default is for
             allowing prefix or suffix strings that are used in translations
             but not in the original. In this case the default is set to an
             empty string ('').


Contexts
========

To reduce the amount of time spent on finding strings in the translation
XML files, the strings are placed inside "context groups".
When looking up a string id, only context groups which are marked with the
context given to the gsa:i18n function will be searched.


General guidelines for assigning and creating new contexts and groups
---------------------------------------------------------------------

When grouping strings, you should look for a compromise between the following:

* Generic terms should use generic contexts to avoid redundant definitions
   or inclusion into contexts that do not use them.

* More specific strings should be used in specific contexts to keep the more
   generic ones small.

* To make finding the correct context easier you can put semantically similar
   strings into a group for more contexts than strictly necessary so they
   are not scattered throughout different context groups.

* The amount of context assignments and groups should not grow too large to
   reduce time searching them.


Currently used contexts:
------------------------
"Logo"  : Strings used in the the logo header
"MM"    : (Top level) main menu items
"Login" : The login page
"Help"  : Item labels for the Help menu / "Help: <Resource Type>"

"Pagination" : Strings used for pagination labels
"Filter Box" : The filter box at the top of table pages.
"Time"       : Time related strings.
"Severity"   : Severity related strings like the levels "High", "Medium", etc.
"Status"     : Task status strings like "Running" or "Stop Requested"

"Type"        : Capitalized singular resource type names, e.g. "Task"
"Type Plural" : Capitalized plural resource type names, e.g. "Tasks"
"Type Lower"        : Lower case singular resource type names, e.g. "task"
"Type Plural Lower" : Lower case plural resource type names, e.g. "tasks"

"Table Row"  : Generic actions, properties, etc. used inside table rows.
               To be used many times on a single page.
"Window"     : Generic actions, properties, etc. used everywhere except
                table rows.
               To be used sparsely, e.g. on details pages.

"<RT>"           : The type name of the resource type <RT> as well as
                   variants of very common terms like "New <RT>" or
                   "<RT> Details".
"<RT> Table Row" : Actions, properties, etc. specific to the resource type
                   <RT> used inside table rows.
                   To be used many times on a single page.
"<RT> Window"    : Actions, properties, etc. specific to the resource type
                   <RT> used everywhere except table rows.
                   To be used sparsely, e.g. on details pages.

"Trashcan"        : Strings used by the Trashcan page.
"My Settings"     : Strings used by the "My Settings" page.
"Performance"     : Strings used by the Performance page.
"CVSS Calculator" : Strings used by the Performance page.
"Feed Sync"       : Strings used by feed sync page like "NVT Sync"
"Wizard"      : Strings shared by all wizards
"Task Wizard" : Strings used by the Task Wizard
"Advanced Task Wizard" : Strings used by the Advanced Task Wizard


Structure of translation files
==============================

Elements
--------
  i18n : root element, contains multiple grp elements.
  grp  : context group (See section "Contexts"), can contain multiple
          ctxt and msg elements.
  ctxt : context assignment, all messages in the same group will be available
          in this context (See section "Contexts").
  msg  : message, consisting of an id and a translated string (str).
  id   : identifier string (usually untranslated version of a string)
  str  : translated string


Template for new resource types
-------------------------------

  <!-- 3.X      RESOURCEs -->
  <!-- 3.X.1    RESOURCE type name and common strings -->
  <grp>
    <ctxt>RESOURCE</ctxt>
    <ctxt>RESOURCE Window</ctxt>
    <!-- - - Type name - - -->
    <!-- - - Common actions - - -->
    <!-- - - Common references - - -->
  </grp>
  <!-- 3.X.2    RESOURCE actions and properties - all views -->
  <grp>
    <ctxt>RESOURCE Table Row</ctxt>
    <ctxt>RESOURCE Window</ctxt>
    <!-- - - Actions - - -->
    <!-- - - Properties - - -->
    <!-- - - References and reference actions - - -->
  </grp>
  <!-- 3.X.3    RESOURCE actions and properties - window / headers only -->
  <grp>
    <ctxt>RESOURCE Window</ctxt>
    <!-- - - Actions - - -->
    <!-- - - Properties - - -->
    <!-- - - References and reference actions - - -->
  </grp>
  <!-- 3.X.4    RESOURCE actions and properties - table rows only -->
  <grp>
    <ctxt>RESOURCE Table Row</ctxt>
    <!-- - - Actions - - -->
    <!-- - - Properties - - -->
    <!-- - - References and reference actions - - -->
  </grp>
  <!-- 3.X.5    (Groups of special specific strings like Task Status) -->


Creating new GSA page translations
==================================
The easiest way to create a new translation for GSA is to copy an existing,
up-to-date language file (like de.xml) in the src/html/classic/po directory
and replace the existing translated strings with ones in the language you are
translating to.
If you don't plan to translate all of GSA at once, you can also copy only
the parts of the language file that contain the elements you wish to
translate at the time. In this case the untranslated sections will fall back
to the default language (English).

The new file must be UTF-8 encoded and named "<lc>.xml" where <lc> is the
ISO 639â€‘1 two-letter language code like it is also used by HTTP Accept-Language
headers (e.g. "fr" for French or "nl" for Dutch).
You also have to add the language to the xsl:choose element of the xsl variable
i18n_po_path, which is found in src/html/classic/gsad.html .
The line added should look like this, "lc" again being the language code:

    <xsl:when test="$i18n_language = 'lc'">po/lc.xml</xsl:when>

Finally, your new language file has to be installed in
${GSA_DATA_DIR}/classic/po. To make it part of the standard installation,
add it to the appropriate list of files in the CMakeList.txt file in the base
GSA source directory.


Translating help pages
======================
Translations for the help pages are contained in a file called "help_<lc>.xsl",
where <lc> is the the two-letter language code the translation is for.

For the stylesheet to work properly, it must include the default "help.xsl"
at the beginning. 

Next should be the named templates, which must use different names than the
included default stylesheets. This is to avoid conflicts which would not only
affect the template, but cause all of the XSL transformation to fail.

For consistency you should use the name of their default stylesheet equivalent
suffixed with an underscore and the language code.
For example "availability" becomes "availability_de" if the language code is
"de".

After this the "Page not found" template should be placed, followed by the
individual page templates.

The new help file should also be UTF-8 encoded and has to be installed in the
directory ${GSA_DATA_DIR}/classic.
