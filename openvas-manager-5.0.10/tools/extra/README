openvas-manager/tools/extra

This directory is for tools that are not necessary for openvas-manager,
but could be useful in some particular cases.


xml_split:

This utility is able to split a huge XML file in a memory efficient way, while
keeping the exact structure and content of the original file. This can be used
for instance during scap-update on machines that are low on RAM to reduce the
amount of necessary RAM to perform the update.

How to enable: In the *scap-data-sync script use a value greater than 0
for variable "SPLIT_PART_SIZE" and install xml_split to apropriate place.
